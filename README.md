Checkers Over IP
-------------------------------------------

My girlfriend and I like to play board games. Being seperated at college makes this a little difficult, so as a fun programming project, I decided to write a checkers game that we could play together. An XMLRPC server is hosted on one computer and the other computer connects to it. The hosting computer must not be behind a router or have port forwarding setup on the 8000. It isn't the best setup, but it is just for fun and it works.
###Use:
####Dependencies-

- python 3.4
- PyQt4

####Running-
main.py in the root directory is the main script for the program and will execute via 'python3 main.py' on Mac & Linux and 'python main.py' on Windows from the command line.
